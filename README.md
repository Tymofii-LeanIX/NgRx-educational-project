# README
## NgRx Educational Project
This project is an educational project aimed at demonstrating the use of NgRx for state management in Angular applications. The project is a simple book store application where users can view a list of books, view details of a book, and add books to a cart.

## The repository is organized as follows:
- src/app: This directory contains the main application code.
- pages: This directory contains the components for the different pages in the application.
- services: This directory contains the services used in the application.
- store: This directory contains the NgRx store, actions, effects, and reducers.
- shared: This directory contains shared types and interfaces.
- src/assets: This directory contains static assets such as images and music.

## Locating Changes
To locate changes made to the repository, you can use the commit history. Each commit represents a set of changes made to the codebase. By selecting a commit, you can view the specific changes made in that commit, including the files changed and the specific lines of code added or removed.

## Running the Project
To run the project, you will need to have Node.js and Angular CLI installed. Once these are installed, you can run the following commands:

- Install dependencies: npm install
- Start the application: ng serve
- The application will then be available at http://localhost:4200.
